## How to run the code ##
* Install "The Haskell Platform" [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).
* Go to the directory "CODE".
* Type ``ghci`` and then, in ghci, type ``:l SOMC.hs``.
* Now you can play with the code! You can invoke the main function (which is not useful at the moment) by typing ``main`` in ghci.
* For further information, visit the wiki.

## What is this repository for? ##
* grouping data
* pre-processing data

## Contribution guidelines ##
Make sure the code compiles fine. Funny annotations are... funny, but please no spam. Comments, branches, notes and ``main.tex`` may be written in german, but the wiki and code should always be english so that collaborators can easily understand what's going on. Translations and bi-language content does no harm.

### Who do I talk to? ###
* Repo owner or admin
* If you are in Erfurt: Julius Quasebarth, Robin Hankel and Luisa Derer at the Albert Schweitzer Spez. (grammar school).
